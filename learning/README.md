## Learning modules

These methods are mostly wrappers around gridsearchCV, PredefinedSplit, and the appropriate sklearn model

Note: SVM.py does not converge in a timely fashion currently with the dataset, even with a large cache size.
Further preprocessing may be necessary to preprocess the data with SVM?
